# Slug Feed
_A better way to slug it out on the internet._

This goal of the this project is to improve website comment sections. The main ways it hopes to do this are:
- Letting users know how their comments come across (through sentiment analysis)
- Bringing comments to the same visual space as specific article sections to improve context.
- Splitting comments into Agree/Disagree to reduce filter bubbles from popularity contests.
