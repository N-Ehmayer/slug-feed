## Project Description

**Tagline:** Comment Driven News

**Inspiration:** Hybrid of Medium's articles & Reddit's Comments

**Elevator Pitch:** We encourage engagement and discussion by integrating comments into content.

**What it is:** Instead of keeping comments all the way at the bottom of articles, we put them center stage alongside the content that inspired them. Comments are then separated by positive & negative reactions to show different perspectives on the content. Overall article sentiment helps sort the website content.

**Why people would use it:** 

- The drama of the battleground between opposing sides
- People can see immediately if something is disputed in an article
- Contextual interaction between content creators and commenters
